# About

This is a very minimal configuration of Emacs with Org Mode and Org Roam just to make it more friendly for first-timers in a 202X setting.

Very little has been done to make it "the perfect IDE", so don't expect a lot.

Comments have been left for things that aren't really vanilla, but are also something that might be of interest, such as ob-go or the Org Protocol.
